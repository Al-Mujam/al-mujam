Accommodation
Student Housing at Almujam
A Comfortable Living Environment That Supports Learning
At Almujam, we believe that a student's academic success is closely tied to their overall living experience. A well-organized and comfortable home environment can be just as impactful as quality instruction, effective curriculum, and a supportive classroom atmosphere.
For this reason, our dedicated housing support team assists students with all aspects of accommodation. This includes helping with housing placement, matching students with compatible housemates, and offering guidance on budgeting, essential items to bring, and day-to-day life in Amman.
Over the past fifteen years, students have consistently expressed how valuable these services have been to their overall learning experience. While such personalized support is uncommon at most Arabic institutes in the region, we consider it a central part of our responsibility as your hosts throughout your time in Amman.
The Housing Request Process
To ensure that every student has a place to stay, we have developed a clear process for requesting housing. This process applies to all students who are not part of a prearranged housing agreement through a Partner Program.
Step One: Submit the Housing Request Form
All students—whether new or returning—must complete the housing form prior to the beginning of the term. This applies to anyone planning to use Almujam Housing or to arrange their own Independent Housing.
If you meet these criteria after the launch of the housing campaign, you will receive access to the form once the campaign begins.

Housing Options
Almujam offers two main housing pathways to suit different needs and preferences.

Tips on where and how to search for housing
Information about recommended neighborhoods
Practical advice on costs, contracts, and safety
After You Submit the Form
Once the housing campaign begins, eligible students will receive detailed instructions, including the application link and a schedule of next steps.

Our Approach to Housing
Because Where You Live Matters
At Almujam, we do not consider student housing a secondary concern. In fact, we view it as a critical factor in the overall success of your study abroad experience. A safe, functional, and thoughtfully arranged living space is essential to helping you focus, feel secure, and thrive during your time in Amman.
Many students have joined top-tier Arabic programs and studied with inspiring instructors, only to find their experience deeply affected by inadequate housing conditions. From broken showers and unreliable internet to uncomfortable furniture and unhelpful landlords, these challenges can turn an exciting journey into a daily struggle.
We believe that your housing situation should support your learning—not distract from it. That is why we have taken the time to speak with students over the past decade to understand their housing experiences in Amman, especially those who chose to arrange accommodation independently.
Here are some of the most common challenges they shared with us:
Common Challenges Faced by Students in Independent Housing
The Housing Search
Finding and securing housing can be overwhelming, especially for first-term students. The process is often stressful, time-consuming, and filled with unexpected complications.
Poor Internet Connectivity
Reliable internet is essential for study, communication, and daily life. Yet, students often report slow, unstable connections and poor technical support in many housing options.
Water Issues
Water supply in Amman is rationed weekly, and not all landlords invest in adequate water tanks or plumbing. Problems with water pressure, availability, or drainage are a recurring concern.
Inactive or Unhelpful Building Porters
Most apartment buildings in Jordan have a porter responsible for safety and maintenance. Unfortunately, the quality of service varies widely. Some students benefit from attentive porters, while others struggle with unresponsive or absent staff.
Low-Quality Furniture
While luxury is not expected, functional and safe furniture is essential. Some landlords provide worn or fragile pieces that barely serve their purpose, leading to discomfort and frustration.
Distance from Campus and Daily Essentials
Living far from Almujam or central areas can make commuting expensive and time-consuming. Traffic in Amman is unpredictable, and students often find themselves spending significant time and money on transportation.
Seasonal Weather Challenges
While spring and fall offer mild weather, summer and winter can be extreme. Many homes are not equipped with sufficient heating or cooling, making it difficult to stay comfortable during these months.
Poorly Equipped Kitchens
Lack of basic appliances or kitchenware forces students to rely on eating out, which adds significantly to living costs. Students have reported that missing kitchen essentials created unexpected financial strain.
Unresponsive Landlords
When problems arise, having a landlord who is cooperative and responsive makes a big difference. In independently managed housing, landlords may be slow to act—or not act at all.
Incompatible Housemates
Few things affect your living experience more than the person you share your space with. Personality clashes or lifestyle differences can create significant stress, especially when there is no system in place for matching housemates.
What This Means for You
If you are still reading and haven’t changed your mind about coming to Amman, then you are exactly the kind of student we’re excited to welcome. The good news is that Almujam has taken all of these experiences into account when shaping our housing options and support services.
In the next sections, you will find details about the two main housing paths we offer, along with costs, processes, and helpful guidelines to ensure your stay is as smooth and enriching as possible.
Housing Options at Almujam
Designed for Your Comfort, Stability, and Focus
When designing our student housing services at Almujam, we began with one question: What do students truly need in order to feel safe, supported, and focused during their Arabic learning journey? Drawing directly from the feedback of former students, we created two practical and student-friendly paths for accommodation.
Two Clear Options for Housing
To keep things simple and flexible, Almujam offers two primary housing options:
Almujam Housing (fully managed by our team)
Independent Housing (student-arranged, with optional guidance from us)
Each of these options is designed to suit different personalities, needs, and levels of independence. Below is a detailed breakdown of each path.

Almujam Housing
Managed Living for a Focused Study Experience
Students who choose Almujam Housing will live in shared, gender-specific apartments located in safe and well-connected neighborhoods near the institute. Many units are located near one another, helping to build a natural community among Arabic learners.
Apartments are outfitted and customized to meet student needs and are regularly maintained by our in-house Housing Care team. During business hours, support staff are available to assist with any issues, while a separate after-hours support line is available for urgent matters—providing students with 24/7 access to assistance in English.
Most apartments are within a short walking distance of Almujam, and are close to essential services such as supermarkets, shopping centers, restaurants, fresh produce markets, and gyms. Public transportation is also accessible and connects students to other parts of the city.
Almujam Housing includes five room types, each with its own pricing and features. Full details are outlined later in this page. Please note that, for safety reasons, students are not permitted to live alone in an apartment. If you believe you have exceptional circumstances, please contact us directly to discuss your case.
For married students or those attending with family, we offer a personalized housing support service through our Facilitated Housing program. Please contact us at m.albishawi@almujamedu.com for individualized guidance.

Independent Housing
Greater Flexibility, With More Responsibility
Independent Housing is a suitable option for students who prefer to explore housing opportunities on their own. While this approach allows for more freedom and the chance to see apartments in person before committing, it also carries a higher level of risk and responsibility.
In some cases, our Housing Support team may be able to arrange a short housing tour during orientation for students pursuing this option. However, students are responsible for choosing their housemates, finalizing lease terms, and managing their own living arrangements.
It is important to note:
Most landlords require full upfront payment for short-term leases.
Contract terms vary and may not include early termination options.
Almujam does not intervene in maintenance or landlord disputes for independently arranged housing.
Nearby neighborhoods that are commonly considered by students include areas close to the institute, walkable cultural districts, and residential zones with access to public services and transportation.

Considerations and Recommendations
Which Housing Option Is Right for You?
Almujam Housing is best for students who:
Prefer to avoid the stress of finding housing after arrival
Value proximity to Almujam, supermarkets, and daily conveniences
Appreciate structured support, maintenance services, and emergency assistance
Want to settle in quickly and focus on their studies
Are looking for a safe, social environment with fellow Arabic learners
Independent Housing may suit students who:
Are comfortable with uncertainty and decision-making after arrival
Prefer to select their apartment and housemates in person
Have experience managing leases, local landlords, and housing logistics
Are seeking maximum privacy or cultural immersion
Have advanced Arabic skills and familiarity with Jordanian systems

Our Recommendation for First-Term Students
For first-term students, our clear and strong recommendation is to choose Almujam Housing. It minimizes stress and logistical challenges, allowing you to focus on your academic goals from day one. Once you are more familiar with Amman and local culture, you may consider transitioning to Independent Housing for future terms.
Past students who started with Almujam Housing often chose to later explore different neighborhoods or live with Arabic-speaking housemates to fully immerse themselves in the language. This progression is natural, and we support it fully for students who feel ready.

For married students or those attending with family, please email m.albishawi@almujamedu.com to receive personalized support through our Facilitated Housing program.

Why Choose Almujam Housing?
A Complete, Hassle-Free Experience
Once you submit your housing application and complete the payment, our team takes care of everything. From airport pickup in Wi-Fi-equipped vehicles to move-in-ready apartments, your arrival experience is stress-free and seamless.
High-Speed Internet Included
All Almujam apartments come equipped with fast, reliable internet (up to 200GB monthly) at no additional charge—perfect for online studies, communication, and streaming.
Full Maintenance Support
Our dedicated Housing Care Team handles all maintenance issues, including water, electricity, or appliance problems—no need to search for a handyman on your own.
Flexible Rental Dates
Unlike most private landlords, we only charge for the actual term of your stay, with a few days before and after for moving in and out. No unnecessary full-month charges.
Clean and Practical Furniture
Each apartment includes essential, durable furniture and bedding (bottom sheet, cover blanket, pillow with case). Students only need to bring personal bath towels and washcloths.
Convenient Location
Apartments are located within short walking distance of Almujam, local supermarkets, restaurants, produce markets, and public transportation—saving you time and daily commuting costs.
Seasonal Temperature Control
Apartments are equipped with a combination of cooling fans, AC units, diesel heating, or portable heaters to ensure comfort throughout the year.
Fully Equipped Kitchens
Kitchens include standard appliances and cookware—gas ovens, refrigerators, microwaves, utensils, and dishes—ready for daily cooking.
Bi-Monthly Cleaning
Shared spaces, including bathrooms and floors, are cleaned twice per month. Bedrooms remain the student’s private responsibility for cleanliness.
Thoughtful Housemate Matching
Our team carefully reviews housing applications to place students with compatible housemates. Most apartments accommodate 3–5 students, with some larger apartments housing up to 10.
24/7 Emergency Support
Unexpected situation? Our team is always a phone call away—day or night, weekday or holiday.

Note: If you are assigned a private room with multiple beds or wardrobes, this does not mean you will share the room. These configurations allow flexible assignment during high-demand terms.

Understanding Winter in Amman
Stay Warm, Stay Safe
Winter in Jordan can surprise students with chilly indoor temperatures due to stone building construction and high heating costs. Almujam supports a range of heating systems and offers tips to help students stay warm and manage utility expenses wisely:
Limit heating hours, use layers of clothing
Wear slippers and a knit hat indoors
Get a second blanket and consume warm drinks
Monitor heating fuel usage if applicable

Commitments and Cancellations
When you submit your request for Almujam Center Housing, we do our utmost to arrange and reserve the best study-abroad accommodations available for you, fully trusting that you intend to fulfill your financial commitment for all housing fees for the entire academic term.
We kindly ask that you do not use Almujam Center Housing as a "backup" option by applying here while also seeking independent housing. Often, students who do this receive a reservation from Almujam Center Housing but then decline it because they have committed elsewhere, unintentionally causing inconvenience for other students.
Please understand that the Hospitality Team invests significant effort, care, and costs from the moment you apply, including:
Carefully reviewing each housing application to find compatible roommates and housemates,
Striving to assign you the closest room type and budget you requested,
Accommodating any special needs you may have,
Prioritizing your preferences if you are renewing your room agreement for a new term,
Leasing apartments and rooms on your behalf for the entire term,
Preparing your apartment and room to be clean and comfortable upon arrival,
And managing many other detailed processes to make Almujam Center Housing your ideal home away from home.
Cancellations create significant disruptions as we must rapidly reorganize housemate and apartment arrangements, impacting other students and potentially increasing housing costs for everyone.
You are welcome to secure independent housing if you prefer, but please do not use Almujam Center Housing as a fallback. Once you are awarded a housing assignment, we expect your full commitment.
Therefore, acceptance of the housing agreement is binding. By reserving your accommodation, we trust you will fulfill your financial responsibilities for all housing costs for the entire term.
We do understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise. If, due to extenuating circumstances, you notify us of a cancellation request within 5 days after your scheduled move-in date (regardless of whether you have moved in), a member of Almujam Center’s hospitality team will review your case. If approved, a cancellation fee of 35% of the total term rent will apply, while any prepaid checkout deposit will be refunded minus cleaning and transaction fees. Almujam Center will bear the remaining 65% of the rent cost.
After this 5-day grace period, if you leave early for any reason (except for emergency situations approved by Almujam Center), you will remain fully responsible for the housing fees for the entire term.
Students who are involuntarily discontinued from enrollment must vacate Almujam Center Housing within 3 days of discontinuation and remain responsible for all applicable housing fees.

Process Overview
At the bottom of this page, you will find a link to access the housing preference form for the relevant academic term. Full details are provided within the form itself, but here is an overview to help you understand the process.
If you prefer Almujam Center Housing, please keep in mind:
Almujam Center Housing is often oversubscribed during busy seasons, meaning there are more applications than available spots for first and second choices. To allocate rooms fairly, we use a housing lottery system similar to those used at many universities worldwide:
All admitted students who complete their housing application before the deadline have an equal chance of receiving housing, regardless of whether they apply on day 1 or just minutes before the deadline.
Applications submitted after the deadline are still considered but are less likely to receive their top room choices.
Continuing students already living in Almujam Center Housing are given priority in the selection process.
Eligibility requirements for Almujam Center Housing (newly admitted students):
Enrollment in at least 7.5 weekly hours of instruction at Almujam Center (private tutoring or conventional courses). For summer terms, students should register for 10 hours/week.
Submission of the housing preference form selecting “Almujam Center Housing.”
Payment of the tuition deposit.
Acknowledgment of all sections of the study policy agreement.
All these steps must be completed by the deadline shown in the housing preference form and at the top of this webpage.
Filling the housing preference form:
Please list each desired room type only once.
We strive to accommodate everyone’s first or second choice; however, due to high demand and limited supply, this cannot be guaranteed.
Be prepared financially to pay for your third most expensive room type, as this may be the only option available.
Notifications and housing assignments:
About one week after the form opens, we will email you to inform whether you have been awarded a spot.
If accepted, you will receive a housing assignment letter with your room type, total term rent, and move-in/check-out dates.
Confirm your acceptance within the deadline to secure your room.
If not awarded a spot, you will be placed on a waitlist or may pursue Independent Housing.
Shuttle Service for New Students:
New students requesting complimentary shuttle service from the airport to their Almujam Center Housing residence should contact us directly via email or phone. Upon arrival, look to your right after baggage claim to meet a driver who will provide your key set and take you to your accommodation.
Independent Housing:
If you prefer Independent Housing, simply select that option on the housing form.
While Almujam Center does not offer apartment or roommate search services for independent housing, we recommend starting your search early on sites such as:
www.expatriates.com
www.airbnb.com
www.opensouk.com
Students seeking shuttle service to independently arranged housing should also contact us directly.

If you plan to arrive earlier than the official move-in day, we can provide information on nearby hotels and hostels. Students arriving early who have requested shuttle service will be greeted at the airport and transported to their early-arrival accommodation.

During Your Stay
We strive to ensure your housing meets expectations and supports your studies and cultural experience. Should any issues or questions arise, please contact us using the details at the bottom of this page.
Midway through the term, Almujam Center Housing residents will receive a Continuing Student Survey via email to express their intent to continue or conclude their studies. Those continuing will receive further information on housing renewal procedures.

Checkout Procedures
All residents must schedule a room inspection within one week before their official checkout or early departure date. Following inspection, tenants may visit Almujam Center’s accounting office for a possible partial refund of their checkout deposit.
Tenants not returning to Almujam Center Housing for the next term must return their keys or pay a re-keying fee up to 25 JD depending on missing keys. Detailed checkout instructions will be emailed.
When terms have short gaps (2-3 days), students renewing housing may keep the same room without extra rent for the gap but will still pay utilities. Alternatively, students may travel during the break.

Departing Jordan
Students completing their studies and departing Jordan can sign up for Almujam Center’s complimentary shuttle to Queen Alia Airport by contacting us directly.

Housing Guidelines
Preface
Students should be aware that Jordanian society, while a mosaic of cultural customs and religious practice, tends towards the conservative side, especially in residential family settings. Almujam Center Housing units are situated in such areas, and we therefore expect that all resident students and their guests will adhere to the regulations outlined below. Doing so can help assure optimal relationships with your neighbors and enhance your overall experience while in Amman. In response to violations of these policies, disciplinary action is at the sole discretion of Almujam Center’s Director.
Please note that violations of policies 1 and 2 may lead to strict disciplinary action, including possible eviction from the apartment and expulsion from Almujam Center, without return of the checkout or tuition deposits.
Neighborly Sensitivity
Tenants are to avoid loud sounds and parties, drinking alcohol, possession or use of illicit drugs, or other behaviors disturbing to others that may generate complaints to Almujam Center. This applies to neighbors and includes mutual cooperation among housemates regarding respectful utility usage, cleanliness, quiet hours, visitor arrangements, and related matters.
Guests
Visitors who are not assigned tenants of Almujam Center Housing apartments are subject to the curfew period of 11:00 PM to 8:00 AM, with the following regulations:
Each tenant may host only one visitor during any curfew period unless otherwise permitted by the Almujam Center Housing Coordinator.
Visitors of the opposite gender to the apartment tenants are not allowed during curfew periods.
Visitors of the same gender as the apartment tenants are allowed up to three curfew periods within an academic term unless a complaint is received. Additional stays require prior email consent from the Coordinator and all other tenants.
Between official checkout dates and move-in dates for the next term, any Almujam student residing as a visitor beyond two curfew periods must pay the most proximate term’s daily room rate for each additional curfew period.
All communications regarding visitors must be sent via email to m.albishawi@almujamedu.com.
These rules respect Jordanian social norms regarding gender and privacy and protect the reputation of Almujam Center within the local community and its rental agreements with landlords.
Eligibility
Tenants must maintain a minimum of 1.5 daily hours (7.5 weekly hours) of Arabic instruction at Almujam Center to live in Almujam Center Housing during the respective term.
Trespassing
Tenants and visitors may not enter bedrooms other than their own without express consent from the occupant or the Housing Coordinator if the room is vacant or being vacated.
Sublease Restriction
Subleasing or providing apartment access to third parties in the tenant’s absence is prohibited.
Smoking
Smoking is prohibited indoors and only allowed in outdoor areas, including balconies or patios, provided doors and windows are closed to prevent smoke infiltration. This rule protects others from irritation, fire hazards, and smoke damage to furnishings.
Pets
Animals are not allowed in Almujam Center Housing properties.
Acceptance of Condition
Tenants accept the housing premises “as is” regarding functionality, appearance, and cleanliness and agree to return it in similar condition. Defacing walls or furnishings (e.g., using adhesive tape that peels paint) is forbidden. Requests for alternative furniture or features may be accommodated at the tenant’s expense or shared cost at Almujam Center’s discretion, with ownership of such items retained by Almujam Center.
Rent prices are fixed and not subject to adjustment for differences in room or apartment features, which reflect inherent local market factors.
Right of Entry
Almujam Center reserves the right to enter apartments as needed for emergencies, maintenance, investigation, or cleaning, intending to provide advance notice when possible.
Premature Departure
Tenants leaving before the official checkout date must notify the Housing contact at least one week prior, attend an apartment walk-through with staff, and return their keys. Refunds for unused rent are at Almujam Center’s discretion on a case-by-case basis.
Limit of Liability
Except in cases of proven, intentional negligence by Almujam Center, the institute is not liable for loss or damage to tenants’ or visitors’ persons or property while on premises. Tenants are responsible for themselves and their visitors.
Disclaimer
Housing packages may change due to occupancy or room type adjustments, potentially affecting costs. Such changes are rare and Almujam Center will strive to provide fair notice. The terms here supersede any previous terms and conditions.
Guidelines for students in Independent Housing are less formal and managed directly between students and landlords. Attentiveness to local customs and respect for cultural and religious norms are key to maintaining good neighborly relations.
