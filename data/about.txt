Methodology
Almujam Arabic Language Learning Methodology
A Balanced Approach to Mastering Arabic: Grammar, Conversation, and Culture
At Almujam, we understand that traditional Arabic study methods often focus excessively on grammar, leaving conversational, listening, and writing skills underdeveloped. Many English-speaking learners end up knowing the intricate details of Arabic grammar but struggle to hold simple conversations or read everyday texts fluently.
Our Arabic teaching methodology rejects this imbalance by emphasizing a well-rounded language acquisition approach without sacrificing linguistic detail. We combine targeted exercises in reading, listening, writing, and speaking to develop all language skills simultaneously. Our experienced instructors, with decades of combined expertise teaching Arabic to non-native speakers, tailor lessons to fill gaps in each student’s language ability.
Intensive and Interactive Classes Designed for Maximum Learning
Classes at Almujam meet daily, providing immersive instruction:
Summer sessions: 4 hours per day, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks
Fall, Winter, and Spring sessions: 3 hours per day, 5 days a week, for 12 weeks
Our classrooms offer natural lighting, comfortable seating arranged for interactive dialogue, and an optimal teacher-to-student ratio to maximize engagement. Participation is actively encouraged at all levels, from beginners to advanced students. Additionally, students may join extracurricular activities to practice Arabic in real-life settings.
Classical and Modern Standard Arabic Tracks
The academic program is divided into two specialized tracks:
Classical Arabic
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)
Students may enroll in either or both tracks, progressing through beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels. This flexible approach ensures that learners meet their academic, professional, or cultural goals effectively.
