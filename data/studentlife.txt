Travel and Visas


Travel and Visas
Information for Students Entering Jordan
Getting to Jordan
Jordan is served by several major international airlines. Students traveling from North America, Europe, and Australia can choose from reliable carriers such as Royal Jordanian, Lufthansa, and KLM. If you need assistance making travel arrangements, feel free to contact us. We are happy to offer guidance.
Recommended Airport
Most international students arrive at Queen Alia International Airport (AMM) in Amman. The airport is located approximately 35 minutes from the city center and is Jordan’s main international gateway.
Visa on Arrival for Most Travelers
Holders of passports from the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, European Union, and several other countries are eligible to receive a visa upon arrival at the airport. This is a straightforward process and costs approximately 40 Jordanian dinars (about 56 USD). The visa is valid for 30 days.
Embassy Option
If you prefer, you may also apply for a visa in advance at a Jordanian embassy or consulate in your home country.
For Other Nationalities
If your passport is not from one of the countries listed above, please check the visa requirements with your nearest Jordanian diplomatic mission before traveling.
Land Entry and Border Crossings
While most students fly into Amman, some choose to enter Jordan by land from neighboring countries. If you plan to arrive via land border (from Israel/Palestine, Syria, Saudi Arabia, etc.), please reach out to us in advance so we can provide the latest guidelines and logistical support.
Visa Extensions and Renewals
If you plan to stay in Jordan for longer than one month, you will need to extend your visa.
Step-by-Step Visa Extension Process
Step 1: Upon arrival, obtain a 30-day visa at the airport (if you have not already received one from a consulate).
Step 2: During your first week in Jordan, our team will help you extend your visa to 90 days.
Step 3: If your stay exceeds three months, you will need to apply for another 90-day extension before the first one expires.
Step 4: After six months in Jordan, all visitors are required to exit the country unless they have been granted a residency permit. Most students plan a short trip abroad at this point (e.g., to Turkey, UAE, Lebanon) and then return to Jordan with a new visa.
Residency Permits
As a private educational institution, we do not provide student residency permits. Therefore, students staying longer than six months must leave Jordan and re-enter to renew their visa.
Budget Consideration
Please factor in the potential cost of regional travel every six months, especially if you plan to study in Jordan long-term. Affordable flights are often available via regional budget airlines.

Arrival and Departure
Arrival and Departure Information at Almujam Center
Arrival Recommendations for Arabic Language Students
We strongly recommend that every student arriving at Almujam Center plan to arrive at least two days before the first day of orientation. This allows time to settle into student housing and overcome jet lag. Students with reservations in Almujam Housing should consult the Housing Overview webpage for detailed move-in dates and times. It is essential that all students arrive at least 24 hours before the Orientation session to ensure full focus during this important introduction to the institute.
The formal Orientation at Almujam includes placement exams, an introduction to studying Arabic abroad, a review of institute policies, visa registration, and a cultural tour of historic sites in Northern Jordan.
Policy for Late Arrivals
Students arriving late will still take placement exams, and a condensed Orientation session may be offered if time allows. However, late arrivals are a lower priority due to the intensive academic schedule. We kindly ask all students to respect these timelines to maintain an effective learning environment for their peers.
Early Departure and Exam Scheduling
Almujam’s academic calendar is designed to align with vacation schedules from major educational systems, including those in the US, Canada, and the UK. Despite this, we understand that not all students’ needs will be perfectly met. Students attending 85% or more of each term may request early or take-home final exams. If you require special scheduling accommodations, please indicate this on your application so that arrangements can be made in advance.
Airport Transportation Services for Students
Almujam offers complimentary airport shuttle services to students arriving for the first time. Transportation from the airport to student housing is available 24/7, and return rides to the airport can be arranged for departure flights. Students can apply for this service through the Student Life section on our website by selecting the Airport Transportation option and submitting the application form.
This free service is available to students residing in Almujam Housing or those with independent housing arrangements. To qualify, itinerary confirmation must be submitted at least one week before arrival for winter, spring, and fall terms, and two weeks before arrival for summer term students.
Please note this service is only offered from one week before Orientation begins until two weeks after the last class of the term. Transportation for additional trips during attendance, such as visa renewal excursions, is the responsibility of the student.
