Class Format and Schedule
At Almujam Arabic Language Center, our core program classes are designed to maximize Arabic language acquisition through consistent and immersive study.
Summer Session: Classes meet four teaching hours per day (one teaching hour = 50 minutes), five days per week, over six to nine weeks.
Winter, Spring, and Fall Sessions: Classes meet three teaching hours per day, five days per week, over ten to twelve weeks.
Classes take place in a comfortable, well-equipped learning environment, with students seated around custom-designed U-shaped tables that encourage interaction and discussion. Active participation is a cornerstone of our methodology—students at every level (from Level 1 through Level 5) are encouraged and expected to engage fully to develop their conversational skills.
Administration and Student Support
The administrative team at Almujam plays an active and supportive role in every student’s academic journey through:
Skills Assessment and Placement: Each student undergoes a comprehensive evaluation to ensure appropriate class placement.
Open-Door Policy: Students have regular opportunities to meet with faculty and administration, especially the Student Services Director, to discuss progress, address concerns, and ensure learning objectives are met.
360-Degree Evaluation: Almujam maintains a culture of comprehensive feedback. Students complete thorough evaluations of courses, staff, and administration. These insights are carefully reviewed and acted upon promptly to improve the overall student experience.
Skills Assessment and Placement Exam
Before beginning their course, students must complete:
A written entrance exam, which is divided into three remote assessments covering speaking, reading, and writing skills. For intermediate and advanced students, the total duration is approximately 2-3 hours, while beginners will spend less time.
 An oral interview conducted by qualified instructors.
New students are placed based on combined results from the exam and interview. Returning students’ past performance and ongoing Arabic experience are also factored into their placement.

Classical Arabic
Classical Arabic Program

Immersing Students in the Language of the Qur’an and Classical Texts

At Almujam Arabic Language Center, the Classical Arabic track focuses primarily on the language of the Qur’an, as well as on classical and medieval texts inspired by its style and content. Students gain direct exposure to Islamic legal, theological, philosophical, and mystical works from these periods.

Foundational Skills in Levels 1 to 3
The first three levels build a strong linguistic foundation by developing “linguistic mobility”—the ability to master Arabic grammar, morphology, and rhetoric (nahw, sarf, and balagha). Students excel in reading, understanding, analyzing, translating, and interpreting classical texts. Alongside, they cultivate essential skills in listening, reading, speaking, and writing, necessary for advanced-intermediate fluency.

Advanced Mastery in Levels 4 and 5
Levels 4 and 5 mark a significant milestone where students transition from learning Arabic as a language to using it as a tool for scholarly access to classical literature. These advanced courses include rotating mini-modules—typically two weeks each—covering topics such as Scriptural Exegesis, Classical and Pre-Islamic Poetry, Psychology, Literary Criticism, Islamic History, Theology, Prophetic History, Speech Presentation (Khutba), and Terminology of Sacred Law and Hadith.
The curriculum uses the same classical texts studied in native Arab universities, reflecting the high level of proficiency students achieve at Almujam—often within just 15 months for beginners, and even faster for those with prior Arabic knowledge.

Modern Standard Arabic
Modern Standard Arabic Program
The Official Language of the Arab World and Beyond
The Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) track at Almujam Arabic Language Center teaches the standard literary and communicative Arabic used across the Middle East and North Africa. Recognized as one of the six official languages of the United Nations, MSA serves as the common medium for nearly all formal spoken and written communication throughout the Arab world.
Whether you aim to live, work, or engage professionally in an Arab country, mastering MSA equips you with the most versatile linguistic tool for effective interaction in diverse social, cultural, and occupational settings.
Comprehensive Curriculum from Beginner to Advanced
The first four levels of the program correspond to typical undergraduate university curricula, with each level equivalent to a full academic year of Arabic study. At Almujam, we use our own specially designed curriculum, carefully tailored to ensure smooth progression and balanced development of all four core language skills: listening, reading, speaking, and writing.
Real-world texts are introduced early, so by the end of Level 4, students can confidently function in Arabic outside the classroom environment.
Advanced Proficiency and Specialized Modules in Level 5
Level 5 offers advanced students opportunities to deepen their skills through rotating modules, typically two or three per term, covering diverse topics such as:
Media Arabic
Readings in International Relations
The Arabic Novel and Short Story
Poetry and Literary Criticism
Economics
Students may also tailor their module choices to suit individual goals and interests. Teaching materials consist exclusively of authentic books and audio resources used by native Arab university students.
Graduates of this track are thus well-prepared to engage with Arab society, culture, and literature with fluency and confidence.
